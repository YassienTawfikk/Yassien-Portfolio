      "long_description": "The Automated Defibrillator System bridges software and embedded hardware for safe arrhythmia detection and response. ECG signals are processed in real-time by a desktop application that calculates BPM and identifies tachycardia or bradycardia events. Upon detecting an arrhythmia, the system commands an Arduino-controlled circuit to deliver a controlled low-voltage shock. The system includes temperature monitoring, GUI visualization, and logging, providing a safe, educational environment for understanding biomedical signal processing and hardware integration."

Users can adjust frequency magnitudes using sliders across multiple modes: uniform ranges, musical instruments, vowel elimination, and Wiener filter noise reduction. The application provides interactive spectrogram visualizations, synchronous playback, and real-time reconstruction of the modified signal. It supports both linear and audiogram frequency views, enabling precise analysis and intuitive signal manipulation for research, music, and biomedical applications."
